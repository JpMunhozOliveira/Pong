# Description

This is a simple Pong game created in Unity. Pong is one of the most classic and iconic video games in gaming history 🕹️. Originally released in 1972 by Atari, the game consists of a virtual ping-pong match where players control paddles and try to hit a ball back and forth across the opponent's field 🏓.

The game is considered one of the first commercially successful electronic games in history and helped popularize the electronic gaming industry as a whole 💰.

## Objective

## Conclusion

Despite its simplicity, Pong is a challenging game that requires quick reflexes and skill to control the paddle 👾. Additionally, the game can be played against both the computer and another player, making it a fun multiplayer option 🎮.

Over the years, Pong has received various adaptations and remains a constant presence in gaming pop culture 🎉. Its legacy in the gaming industry is undeniable and its simple yet addictive gameplay continues to attract players of all ages to this day 🌟.
